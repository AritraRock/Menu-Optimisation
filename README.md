# Menu-Optimisation
MIP Optimisation
This is the code repository for the final project submitted for OR LAB, Industrial & Systems Engineering, IIT KGP.
Here we have presented a POC method to optimise the menu of our mess using the Mixed Integer Programming model.
It also gives multiple solutions based on the deviation specified from the Optimal Solution.
Following example of Input and it's corresponding Output demonstrates what it is supposed to do.
